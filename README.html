<h1 id="github_downloader">github_downloader</h1>
<p>This python program will let you download specific folders from any github repository.</p>
<p>This application is hosted on http://gitdl.onrender.com</p>
<p>To download any github folder send get request to http://gitdl.onrender.com/url/{link_of_folder}<br />
here link of folder should be modified as below https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/tree/main/.config should be modified as github.com microsoft terminal tree main .config</p>
<p>there is one more way to use it send post request to http://gitdl.onrender.com/get_add with {‘url’: “unmodified_url_of_the_folder”} response of this will be text (say config) now send get to http://gitdl.onrender.com/download/{response_text} here response is config so url will be http://gitdl.onrender.com/download/config</p>
<p>To test it you can head to http://gitdl.onrender.com/docs</p>
<p>This project is still in development so as of now it cannot download whole repo or just a single file(only a folder i.e. all internal folders and it’s all files) It will give errors when a non github link is provided.</p>
